                        I would like to thank you for being my supervisor. 
                        I believe in your word that you don't fail student if they attended all the classes. From my opinion, youâ€™re the best lecturer in the university and if I have a chance I would come back and study with you again. 
                        Thank you very much.

                        Being an international student and also being one 
                        who left the school system many years after my first degree, I was too scared on how I was going to cope with the MSc. Technology Management but your lecturing strategies and encouraging words 
                        to students have built that confidence in me.
